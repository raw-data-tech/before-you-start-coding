Get the big picture :

    What kind of app is this (web, desktop, ...)?
    How is it layered (standalone, client-server, n-tier, ...)?
    What is the app's purpose? What is it supposed to do?
    Who is the app made for?

See how it works :

    What language(s) is (are) used?
    How is the code structured?
    How is the data structured?

Understand (or at least try to) the way the app has been thought through:

    Has it been thought through at all?
    Is the app clearly optimized? (For performances? For readability?)
    Is the app finished? Or is there room for evolutions?
    Are there signs of multiple releases?
    etc...
